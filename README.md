Feel free to play alone or with another player and try to make the best score as possible.

## Tests Coverage
I have implemented some unit tests to cover more than 80% of the code statement and line for 60% of the branchs .
To run this tests and vizualise the code test coverage, run this following command
>  **npm test -- --coverage**

Then you will be able to visualize the coverage by opening the created :

>     hangman/coverage/lcov-report/index.html file

## Before leaving
**Please, do not hesitate to give me your opinion and advices**.
Especially on the unit-tests implementation, beacause it's pretty new to me.
